    "## Q1. What is logistic regression? And when is it used?\n",
    "- Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used primarily for binary classification tasks. Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts the probability that a given input point belongs to a particular class (e.g., yes/no, true/false, spam/not spam).\n",
    "It outputs probabilities using the sigmoid function, and based on a threshold (commonly 0.5), it classifies the instance into one of the two categories.\n",
    "When it is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Email spam detection\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicting whether a customer will churn\n",
    "\n",
    "- Disease diagnosis (e.g., cancer detection)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Credit scoring (loan approval yes/no)\n",
    "## Q2. What is the sigmoid function and why is it used in logistic regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sigmoid function (also known as the logistic function) is defined as:\n",
    "σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))\n",
    "\n",
    "It maps any real-valued number into a range between 0 and 1, which is ideal for representing probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- # Why it's used:\n",
    "- It transforms the output of the linear equation (wx + b) into a probability score.\n",
    "- This probability can then be thresholded to classify into one of the two classes.\n",
    "- Its derivative is easy to compute, which is useful for gradient-based optimization.\n",

    "# Q4. What does the output of logistic regression represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The output of logistic regression is a probability value between 0 and 1. It represents the likelihood that a given input belongs to the positive class (usually labeled as 1). This probability is derived using the sigmoid function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the output is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0.85, the model is 85% confident that the sample belongs to class 1.\n",
    "- A threshold (e.g., 0.5) is then used to decide the final class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. What are the assumptions of logistic regression?\n",
    "- Linearity of independent variables and log-odds: Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the log-odds of the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No multicollinearity: Independent variables should not be highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Independent observations: Data points should be independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Large sample size: Performs better with a large number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binary output (for binary logistic regression): Only two possible outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. What is multicollinearity and how does it affect logistic regression?\n",
    "- Multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictor variables are highly correlated. This can cause problems such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unstable coefficient estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "Inflated standard errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Difficulty in determining the effect of each independent variable\n",
    "\n",
    "- In logistic regression, multicollinearity makes it hard to interpret coefficients and can reduce the predictive power. To detect it, you can use        the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), and to fix it, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove highly correlated predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use dimensionality reduction (like PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    " - Apply regularization (L1 or L2)\n",
    "# Q7. How do you interpret model coefficients in logistic regression?\n",
    "- Each coefficient in logistic regression represents the change in the log-odds of the dependent variable for a one-unit increase in the predictor, holding all other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "If β is the coefficient for variable X:\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive β → increases the log-odds of the outcome (probability increases)\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative β → decreases the log-odds (probability decreases)\n",

    "# How do you handle imbalanced data in logistic regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imbalanced data occurs when one class significantly outweighs the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resampling:\n",
    "  -  Oversampling the minority class (e.g., SMOTE)\n",
    "  -  Undersampling the majority class\n",
    "  -  Class weights: Use class_weight='balanced' in scikit-learn\n",
    "  -  Anomaly detection: Treat the rare class as an anomaly\n",
    "  -  Evaluation Metrics: Use precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC instead of accuracy\n",
    "  -  Threshold tuning: Adjust the decision threshold to favor the minority class\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q9. What is a decision tree?\n",
    "- A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning model used for both classification and regression tasks. It splits the data into branches using  conditions on input features, eventually reaching a decision at a leaf node.\n",
    "Each node in the tree asks a question based on a feature; the tree grows by answering these questions and routing the data down paths until a final prediction is made\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q10. How does a decision tree make a prediction?\n",
    "- A decision tree makes a prediction by:\n",
    "Starting at the root node\n",
    "Evaluating the condition (e.g., \"Is age > 50?\")\n",
    "Moving left or right based on the answer\n",
    "Repeating this process until it reaches a leaf node, which contains the prediction (class label or value)\n",
